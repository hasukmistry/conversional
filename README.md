## Getting Started

### Install Node Modules & Build Docker Image

> `make setup`

### Run app locally

> `make run`

It runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The changes will be reloaded automatically. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

It will start the react application on the specified port in `docker-compose.yml`. For instance, it will start the app on port 3001 by default. Check the following lines in the `docker-compose.yml`.
```
environment:
    - PORT=3001
```

### Run tests

> `make run-tests`

Launches the test runner. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Run production

> `make run-production`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

This make command will start the app in production mode on the specified port in `docker-compose.yml`.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
